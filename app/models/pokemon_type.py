"""
SQLAlchemy Model – PokemonType
==============================

This module defines the `PokemonType` model, which represents the **elemental
typing of a Pokémon** in Pokémon Let's Go Pikachu / Eevee.

It is an enriched association table linking:
- a Pokémon (`Pokemon`),
- an elemental type (`Type`),
- a slot indicating primary or secondary typing.

Each Pokémon can have one or two types, ordered by slot:
- slot = 1 → primary type
- slot = 2 → secondary type

class PokemonType(Base):
    """
    Association between a Pokémon and its elemental types.

    This table defines the typing of a Pokémon form, including the ordering
    of types via the `slot` field.

    Business rules:
    - A Pokémon can have at most two types.
    - Each slot (1 or 2) can only be used once per Pokémon.
    - Slot ordering is important for display and damage calculations.

    This model is used for:
    - type effectiveness computation,
    - battle simulation,
    - feature generation for machine learning models.
